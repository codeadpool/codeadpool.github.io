            <h2>What is Design Verification (DV) in the context of hardware design, and why is it important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design verifiaiton is process of ensuring that the design functions according to the specifications.</li>
                <li>Verification is critical because it ensures the design meets functional, timing, and power requirements before fabrication.</li>
                <li> Without thorough verification, bugs could lead to costly re-spins, delays in time-to-market, or even failures in real-world applications, 
                    such as consumer electronics or automotive systems. Verification is essential for ensuring reliability, compliance with standards, and overall product quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the difference between simulation and emulation in the context of hardware verification?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulation is a software-based approach where a testbench is written to mimic the behavior of the design under test (DUT).</li>
                <li>Simulation is highly flexible and allows for detailed debugging but can be slow for large designs due to its serial nature.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Emulation is a hardware-based approach where the design is mapped onto FPGAs.</li>
                <li>Emulation is much faster than simulation and is used for large-scale designs or system-level verification.</li>
                <li>It allows for real-world testing with actual software and interfaces but is less flexible for debugging compared to simulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the difference between directed testing and constrained random testing in verification? When would you use each approach?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Directed testing involves manually writing specific test cases to target particular scenarios or corner cases.</li>
                <li>For example, if you have a 2-bit signal with three possible values (00, 01, 10), you would write test cases to explicitly verify each value.</li>
                <li>Directed testing is useful for verifying specific functionalities or paths in the design but can be time-consuming and may not cover all possible scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>(CRV) involves using randomization with constraints to generate a wide range of test scenarios.</li> 
                <li>In CRV, you define constraints to guide the randomization process, ensuring that the generated values are within valid ranges and cover interesting scenarios.</li> 
                <li>For example, you might randomize packet sizes, addresses, or data patterns within defined limits. CRV is automated and can cover a wide range of scenarios, including corner cases, with less manual effort.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the difference between functional coverage and code coverage in verification? Why are both important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code Coverage:</strong> Measures how much of the design code has been exercised during simulation. It includes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Block Coverage:</strong> Measures how many lines of code have been executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>FSM Coverage:</strong> Checks if all states and transitions in a finite state machine have been exercised.</li>
                    <li><strong>Toggle Coverage:</strong> Ensures that every signal toggles between 0 and 1 at least once.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expression Coverage:</strong> Verifies if all possible combinations of conditions in expressions (e.g., if-else, case statements) have been tested.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li><strong>Functional Coverage:</strong> Measures how much of the design functionality has been tested based on the design specification. It uses covergroups and coverpoints to define metrics for specific functionalities. For example, for a FIFO, functional coverage might include testing full, empty, overflow, and underflow conditions.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Importance of Both:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Code Coverage:</strong> Ensures that all parts of the code have been exercised, but it does not guarantee that the design behaves correctly according to its specification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Coverage:</strong> Ensures that the design meets its functional requirements, but it does not guarantee that all parts of the code have been tested.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Together, they provide a comprehensive measure of verification completeness and help define the endpoint of verification.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>What is the difference between assertions and functional coverage? How are assertions used in verification?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Assertions and Functional Coverage:</strong> Serve different but complementary roles in hardware verification.</li>       
                <li><strong>Assertions:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assertions are used to monitor and validate the behavior of signals or interfaces in real-time during simulation. They ensure that specific rules or properties are followed.</li>
                    <li>Assertions are written using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) and can be either immediate (combinational) or concurrent (temporal).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A request signal (req) must be followed by an acknowledgment (ack) within 3 clock cycles: assert property (@(posedge clk) req |-> ##[1:3] ack);.</li>
                    <li>Assertions help catch bugs early and provide detailed debugging information when they fail.</li>
                </ul>

                <li><strong>Functional Coverage:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functional coverage is a metric used to track how much of the design’s functionality has been tested. It is based on the design specification and uses covergroups and coverpoints to define specific scenarios or conditions to be tested.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> For a FIFO, functional coverage might track whether the FIFO has been tested for full, empty, overflow, and underflow conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Key Differences:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assertions:</strong> Focus on real-time monitoring and validation of specific rules or properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Coverage:</strong> Focus on tracking and measuring how much of the design’s functionality has been tested.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Together, assertions and functional coverage ensure both the correctness and completeness of the verification process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the difference between a race condition and a metastability in digital design? How can they be prevented?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Race Condition:</strong> A race condition occurs when two or more signals compete to influence the output in an unpredictable order. This typically happens due to timing violations or multiple drivers trying to control the same signal simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> In Verilog, if two signals are updated in the same simulation time step, the order of execution may be unpredictable.</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use proper synchronization, avoid multiple drivers, and follow good coding practices (e.g., use non-blocking assignments (&lt;=) in sequential logic).</li>
                
                <li><strong>Metastability:</strong> Metastability occurs when a flip-flop or latch input changes too close to the clock edge, violating the setup or hold time requirements. This causes the output to be unresolved for a period of time, potentially leading to timing violations in downstream logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> In clock domain crossings (CDC), if a signal from one clock domain is sampled by a flip-flop in another domain without proper synchronization, metastability can occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use synchronization techniques such as a dual flip-flop synchronizer for CDC, ensure adequate setup and hold times, and follow CDC guidelines.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Key Differences:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Race Condition:</strong> A logical issue caused by concurrent signal updates or timing violations, leading to unpredictable behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metastability:</strong> A physical issue caused by violating setup/hold times, leading to an unstable output in flip-flops.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>By understanding and addressing both issues, designers can ensure reliable and predictable behavior in digital systems.</li>
            </ul>
