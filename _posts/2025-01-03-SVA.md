## Immediate Assertions

- Temporal Nature: Immediate assertions are non-temporal, meaning they check a condition at the current simulation time only. They do not span across multiple clock cycles.
- Evaluation Timing: They are evaluated immediately when the statement is executed in a procedural block (e.g., initial or always block), similar to an if statement.
- Usage Context: Immediate assertions are typically used within procedural blocks and are written using the assert keyword.

```
always_comb begin
    assert (x == y) else $error("x and y are not equal");
end```

## Concurrent Assertions

- Temporal Nature: Concurrent assertions are temporal in nature, meaning they check for a sequence of events or conditions that occur over multiple clock cycles.
- Evaluation Timing: They are evaluated at specific clock edges, based on sampled values of variables. The variables are sampled in the preponed region of the simulation time slot, and the assertion is evaluated during the observe region.
- Usage Context: Concurrent assertions can be placed inside a module, interface, or procedural block. They are written using the assert property keyword and often used for both dynamic simulation and formal verification.

```assert property (@(posedge clk) (req |=> ack));```

This checks that if req goes high on one clock cycle, then ack must go high in subsequent cycles.
