                    <h3>UVM-Based Verification of 5-Stage MIPS Pipeline Processor</h3>
                    <p>Implemented and verified a 5-stage MIPS pipeline processor on Basys3 FPGA, 
                        conducting post-synthesis verification of register file integrity, 
                        interrupt handling, and memory access protocols using SystemVerilog Assertions 
                        (SVA) with the Symbiyosis formal tool.</p>
                    <p>Developed UVM-based testbench using constrained-random techniques, 
                        creating custom functional coverage bins for RC5 encryption/decryption algorithms, 
                        and capturing edge cases including race conditions and memory access corner cases.</p>

                    <h3>UVM-Based Verification of Asynchronous FIFO UVC</h3>
                    <p>Verified an asynchronous FIFO with independent read/write interfaces and clock domain crossing. 
                        Implemented coverage-driven verification and assertion-based checks for protocol compliance.</p>
                    <p>Designed modular UVM testbench using harness and BFM proxy approach for agent communication, 
                        prioritizing vertical reuse. Implemented base tests for initialization, virtual sequences for multi-agent sequencers, 
                        and extended test cases using constrained random stimulus for corner-case testing.</p>

                    <h3>UVM-Based Verification Environment for YAPP Router</h3>
                    <p>Developed a comprehensive UVM testbench with custom UVCs for multi-port packet router verification. 
                        Implemented advanced stimulus generation, layered architecture, and CDV with cross-coverage 
                        between packet attributes and routing decisions.</p>
                    <p>Integrated SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for protocol compliance and temporal logic validation. 
                        Engineered a sophisticated scoreboard with dynamic data structures for real-time transaction matching.</p>

                    <h3>Verification of AXI2APB Bridge Design</h3>
                    <p>Designed and verified a 32-bit AXI2APB bridge, seamlessly integrating AXI4-Lite and APB3 protocols 
                        for efficient transaction processing. Implemented optimized architecture for read/write/burst transfers, 
                        ensured clock domain crossing (CDC) synchronization, and enabled protocol conversion for maximum efficiency.</p>
